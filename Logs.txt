##August 20th 2024 
-Decided to learn Django framework to become more competitive in Software Engineering fields regarding the use of python
-Watched and followed "Programming with Mosh" video: "Python Django Tutorial for Beginners"
    NOTES FROM VIDEO
        -DJANGO FUNDAMENTALS:
            -Batteries Included: Comes with a lot of features out of the box
                -Comes with Admin Site
                -Object-relational Mapper
                -Authentication
                -Caching
            -PERFORMANCE ISNT EVERYTHING
                -Take account Maturity, Stability, Difficulty and Community
            -Best practice is to send data from Server to a Client. It is a server side framework
            -Server provides an API to the Client
            USE DJANGO TO BUILD API FOR AN ONLINE STORE 
            -Install pipenv to virtual invironments in order for dependencies not to clash
            -Had some issues with Python installation, added folder to my Path and fixed the issue 
            -"django-admin startproject project_name" to initialize the project
            -add a period at the end to indicate currDirectory as the project directory
            -use manage.py folder for running server
            -Every Django app has the same structure
                -migrations folder: database tables
                -admin module: determine admin interface
                -apps: configuring app
                -models: define model classes for the app (pulls out db data)
                -tests: write unit tests
                -views: request handler
            -After creating a new app register it in settings module
            VIEWS:
                - a view function is a function that takes a request and gives a response
                - request handler
                - Once you create a view, you need to map it to a URL
            TEMPLATES:
                -Return HTML content to client
            Debugging
                -Create a launch profile using json and configure
            DJANGO Debug Toolbar
                - Debug option
            Building a Data model
                DATA Model:
                    What pieces of data do you want to store? Think Object Oriented Programming
                    Create database modelling and how they relate to each other
            When designing an app they should do ONE thing and do it well
            Make sure to self contain apps and try to have zero coupling between apps
